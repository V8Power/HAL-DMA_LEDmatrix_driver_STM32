# HAL-DMA_LEDmatrix_driver_STM32
A basic STM32 DMA based driver for monochrome led matrix, might be expanded to rgb

There are 3 basic fonts included altough it shouldn't be to bad too use a font from an sd card or similar. The library work in an arduino envirement, but some timer defenitions have to be commented out in the arduino core. The compiler will complain about the right ones. Otherwise it mostly works next to the arduino core.

There are also a fair number of data signals not actually needed for typical panels
